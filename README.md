## About the Game

The project is a simple text-based RPG game, loosely inspired by the board game *Talisman*. The adventure takes place in a non-fantasy setting and is designed for two players. The goal of the game is to defeat the other player (or survive longer). Players can:

- Move around the map
- Collect items
- Fight various beings and each other
- Select character classes
- Level up
- Visit cities with medics, alchemists, witches, and shops

The map is a closed circle, resembling a board game layout, and consists of two types of fields:

- **Inhabited Areas**: Where players can shop or heal wounds.
- **Lands**: Where players encounter monsters, but also useful items for their journey.

Players' inventory is limited to 4 items, which are divided into **weapons** and **armor**.
